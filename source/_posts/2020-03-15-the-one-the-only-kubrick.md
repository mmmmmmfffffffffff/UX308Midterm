A Clockwork Orangeâ€¦ a film I wished more millennials were familiar with. The first time I watched this film was also my first interaction with Mr. Stanley Kubrick. Easily one of my favourite directors and films (with 2001: A Space Odyssey a close second). Kubrick does a phenomenal job of telling stories, often without any words. In Space Odyssey, the first 25 minutes of the film has no dialogue and yet, you understand so much. It truly is a gift to be able to captivate the audience and allow them to understand the story without any verbal communication.
