Tarantino makes some of the greatest films (not prepared for any debates unless you argue with Kubrick). Kill Bill 1 & 2 and Pulp Fiction are my three favourite movies by him. His story telling is so unique and so captivating. I have yet to watch Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, so I would love to hear more about your thoughts on it. Please comment your thoughts below.
