I get it.. it's easy to hate on the new films, simply because they're new and this is not to argue that there haven't been some questionable decisions, but overall The Rise of Skywalker was a nice goodbye to some our favourite characters. 

Without admitting too much, I may have shared one or two tears as I said goodbye to some of my childhood hero's. Princess Leia Organa is the ultimate warrior who has been a hero of mine since I was a kid. When Carrie Fisher passed away, it was a loss for the Star Wars fandom but their ability to incorporate her so beautifully into the new film, showed a true testament to her character.
