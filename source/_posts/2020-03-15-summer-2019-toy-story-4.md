Summer 2019, an under appreciated time. The weather is warm, schools off, no terrifying pandemics, and the new Toy Story 4 film came out. This seems like a reoccurring theme of goodbye film articles (i.e Star Wars article) but this one also made me tear up. Like come on, saying goodbye to your childhood friends (ok, maybe not friends but you know what I mean) isn't easy, ok? Toy Story is a treasure for millennials and should be treated as such. 

Ps. Forky is easily the best character to ever exist. Ever.
